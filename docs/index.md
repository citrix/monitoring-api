# Citrix Monitor Service API 1808

The Monitor Service API is built on the SQL Server Monitor database that is populated during processing and consolidation. The Monitor Service API is based on the ASP.NET Web API Framework.

The Monitor Service API uses the Open Data (OData) protocol, which is a Web protocol for querying and updating data, built upon Web technologies such as HTTP.

The Monitor Service API is a REST-based API that can be accessed using an OData consumer. OData consumers are applications that consume data exposed using the OData protocol.
ASP.NET Web API Framework supports OData Version 3 and Version 4. You can use either endpoints to run your queries.

You can use the API to:

-  Analyze historical trends for future planning

-  Perform detailed troubleshooting of connection and machine failures

-  Extract information for feeding into other tools and processes; for example, using Microsoft Excel's PowerPivot tables to display the data in different ways

-  Build a custom user interface on top of the data that the API provides

-  Run aggregation queries with the OData Version 4 endpoints to get basic grouping and aggregation functionality.

## Data Available using the API

The following types of data are available through the Monitor Service API:

-  Data relating to connection failures

-  Machines in a failure state

-  Session usage

-  Logon duration

-  Load balancing data

-  Hotfixes applied to a machine

-  Hosted application usage

-  Machine level CPU, Memory and Disk usage

-  Process level CPU and memory usage

-  Application usage and failure data

## Monitor Service Schema

For the details of the Monitor Service schema, please refer to: [Monitor Service Schema](./api-schema.png)

To determine the values returned by the Monitor Service OData API, see: [Citrix Monitor Data Model](./api-reference/Monitor.Model.md)

## How to Access the Monitor Service Data

Citrix recommends that you don't use the Methods endpoints of the Monitor Service API directly. They contain operations used by Director to retrieve data requiring complex grouping and high performance standards. The results are available on the Dashboard and Trends pages, and in the export reports in Director.

## Data Access Privilege

To use the Monitor Service OData API, you must be a XenApp and XenDesktop administrator. To call the API, you require read-only privileges; however, the data returned is determined by XenApp and XenDesktop administrator roles and permissions.

For example, Delivery Group Administrators can call the Monitor Service API but the data they can obtain is controlled by Delivery Group access set up using Citrix Studio.

For more information about XenApp and XenDesktop administrator roles and
permissions, see [Delegated Administration](http://docs.citrix.com/en-us/xenapp-and-xendesktop/current-release/director/permissions.html).

## Data Access Security

If you choose to use TLS, you must configure TLS on all Delivery Controllers in the Site; you cannot use a mixture of TLS and non-TLS.
Minimum supported TLS protocol version is TLS 1.2. 

To enforce the usage of TLS 1.2, set the SchUseStrongCrypto registry key as follows.

**Caution:** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that might require you to reinstall your operating system. Citrix cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. Citrix recommends that you back up Windows Registry before changing it.

Save below code to forceTLS1.2.reg and run it:

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319]
"SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319]
"SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001
```

To secure Monitor Service endpoints using TLS, you must perform the following configuration. Some steps need to be done only once per Site, others must be run from every machine hosting the Monitor Service in the Site. The steps are described below.

***Part 1: Certificate registration with the system***

1.  Create a certificate using a trusted certificate manager. The certificate must be associated with the port on the machine that you wish to use for OData TLS.
1.  Configure the Monitor Service to use this port for TLS communication. The steps depend on your environment and how this works with certificates. The following example shows how to configure port 443:
-  Associate the certificate with a port:
```
netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:443
certhash=97bb629e50d556c80528f4991721ad4f28fb74e9

appid='{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}'
```

**Tip**: *In a PowerShell command window, ensure you put single quotes around the GUID in the appID, as shown above, or the command will not work. Note that a line break has been added to this example for readability only.*

***Part 2: Modify the Monitor Service configuration settings***

1. From any Delivery Controller in the Site, run the following PowerShell commands once. This removes the Monitor Service registration with the Configuration Service.    
    ```
    asnp citrix.\*
    \$serviceGroup = get-configregisteredserviceinstance -servicetype
    Monitor | Select -First 1 ServiceGroupUid
    remove-configserviceGroup -ServiceGroupUid
    \$serviceGroup.ServiceGroupUid
    ```
1.  Do the following on all Controllers in the Site:
    -  Using a cmd prompt, locate the installed Citrix Monitor directory (typically in C:\\Program Files\\Citrix\\Monitor\\Service). Within that directory run:
    ```
    Citrix.Monitor.Exe -CONFIGUREFIREWALL -ODataPort 449 -RequireODataSsl
    ```
    - Run the following PowerShell commands:
    ```
    asnp citrix.\* (if not already run within this window)
    get-MonitorServiceInstance | register-ConfigServiceInstance
    Get-ConfigRegisteredServiceInstance -ServiceType Config |
    Reset-MonitorServiceGroupMembership
    ```

## Data Access Protocol

The Monitor Service API is a REST-based API that can be accessed using an OData consumer. OData consumers are applications that consume data exposed using the OData protocol. OData consumers vary in sophistication from simple web browsers to custom applications that can take advantage of all the features of the OData Protocol.

Every part of the Monitor Service data model is accessible and can be filtered on the URL. OData provides a query language in the URL format you can use to retrieve entries from a service. You can use the OData V3 or OData V4 endpoints to run your queries. OData V4 supports aggregation queries.

The query is processed on the server side and can be filtered further using the OData protocol on the client side.

The data modeled falls into three categories: aggregate data (the summary tables), current state of objects (machines, sessions, etc.), and log data, which is really historical events (connections, for example).

**Note:** Enums are not supported in the OData protocol; integers are used in their place. To determine the values returned by the Monitor Service OData API, see [Monitor Service Data Model](./api-reference/Monitor.Model.md).

### What is OData Protocol?

[OData](http://www.odata.org/) (Open Data Protocol) is an [OASIS standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=odata) that defines a set of best practices for building and consuming RESTful APIs. OData helps you focus on your business logic while building RESTful APIs without having to worry about the various approaches to define request and response headers, status codes, HTTP methods, URL conventions, media types, payload formats, query options, etc.

OData also provides guidance for tracking changes, defining functions/actions for reusable procedures, and sending asynchronous/batch requests.

OData RESTful APIs are easy to consume. The OData metadata, a machine-readable description of the data model of the APIs, enables the creation of powerful generic client proxies and tools.
